A very basic and potentially inefficient implementation of the algorithm.

# Dependencies:

The program relies on python typechecking, and thus needs python 3.8 or newer to work reliably.
Additionally, the following python libraries are needed to run the code:

 -  numpy
 -  scipy

# Running:

Currently, the `perm-check/postcondition.py` file can be run. This will run both the methods on some
randomly generated data, and will print out the time each took.
